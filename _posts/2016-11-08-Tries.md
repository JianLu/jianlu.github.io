**Tries**, also known as **prefix trees**, are an easy way to encode values that share a common prefix,
and easily query which values share a given prefix.

## Data Structure

A Trie is a tree where the path from the root to the leaf represents a string in the dictionary.

### Create Tries

At the beginning, a trie is just a root tree node.
Each time we read a string, we insert the string into the trie.
1. Let `P` point to the root node, and `i` points to the first character of the string
2. Check if `s[i]` is already in children list of `P`:
    1) If yes, then move `P` to the child node and `i ++`
    2) If no, create a new child node for `P` with the key `s[i]`, then move `P` and `i++`
3. Repeat step 2 until you are out of characters in the string

Note that for each string, we need to add a stop value (e.g. None) as a child of the node
to indicate taht the string is complete.

### Examples

The following is a Trie of the string set *[foo, foobar, foobaz]*.

### Search

Searching for a string in a trie is basically the same as inserting one,
except that instead of adding a new node when you encounter a character that isn't encoded,
you return `False` indicating that the string isn't found.
If you get to the end of the string and there's not an indicator that this complete string exists
(a None as a child, in this example), then return `False`.
Otherwise, return `True`.

### Finding all strings starting with a given prefix

Firstly, find the tree node encoding the given prefix.
Then, find all leaf nodes in the subtree whose root is the found node.
You can use either DFS (better is you only want to return one leaf) or BFS.

## Python implementation

### TrieNode

<div class="code-title">
<span class="code-fold" id="fold-btn-1" onclick="$use('fold-body-1', 'fold-btn-1')">[-]</span>
TrieNode Class
</div>

~~~ python
class TrieNode(object):
    def __init__(self, value, string):
        self.value = value
        self.children = {}
        self.string = string
~~~
{: #fold-body-1}
