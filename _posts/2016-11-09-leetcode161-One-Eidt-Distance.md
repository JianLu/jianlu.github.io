<http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-two-given-strings-are-at-edit-distance-one/>{: target="_blank"}

An edit between two strings is one of the following changes:

* Add a character
* Delete a character
* Change a character

Given two string s1 and s2, find if s1 can be converted to s2 with exactly one edit. 
Expected time complexity is O(m+n) where m and n are lengths of two strings.

---

## Solution

There are three cases:

1. Two strings have the same length, then check if there is only one character different.
2. Two strings have 1 different on length, then check if one can be generated by adding 1 character to another.
3. Otherwise, return False
